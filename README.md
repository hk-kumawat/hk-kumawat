## What I'm currently working on

Getting my foundations right - JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and FastAPI, before moving into AI systems.

Building real projects as I go. First deployment coming soon.

I only list what I've actively written code with. The AI stack comes after the foundation is solid.

## Background

Built several ML projects during my diploma using tutorials. I can't explain all of them deeply, so I've made those private.

Now focused on building real AI systems, not more tutorial projects.

I'd rather have three projects I can fully explain than fifteen I copy-pasted.
